# outfox-ts-to-lua

Project made to port TypeScript into OutFox Lua

## Status

This is a unfinished project where I tried to port all of OutFox Lua API into TypeScript types, the goal was to make it possible to theme/mod with Typescript and let this project handle the conversion into Lua, I have long stopped working on this project because I have started to work since then and I'm already part of way too many side-projects to take care of, however, much has already been done here and I want to leave it out there in case someone wants to see what I have done.

## Credits

- Jose_Varela helped me a lot giving advices and to explain what exactly some non-documented types are on the whole stepmania ecosystem
- [TypeScriptToLua Project](https://typescripttolua.github.io/) this would simply not even exist without them, they provided a lot of help on their Discord too.
